Clinical Access Protocol: Robotics & Aviation Systems
=====================================================

Required Credentialing for 6th Floor Access -- Fred Hutch Cancer Center, Clinic Building 1
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This document serves as the required clinical readme and certification summary for personnel accessing the 6th floor of Clinic Building 1 at Fred Hutch Cancer Center. Per the request of the Tripler Pharmacology team, this protocol integrates advanced robotics oversight with specialized aviation systems knowledge.

### **Robotics & Pathogen Analysis Overview**

The 6th-floor laboratories utilize a system of minimal human intervention to enhance safety and efficiency in infectious disease research. This framework, pioneered at USAMRICD, allows for the study of high-risk pathogens without the physical presence of researchers in Level 4 environments.

-   **Remote Operations**: Utilizing robotic systems to manipulate equipment and conduct experiments from a safe distance.

-   **Precision Systems**: Integration of NASA Robonaut technology for complex laboratory tasks requiring unwavering accuracy.

-   **Continuous Monitoring**: Robotic entities enable 24/7 analysis and dataset evaluation without the limitations of human fatigue.

-   **Specialized Research**: Advanced imaging for the study of Pycnogonida and Physalia Physalis to understand viral interactions and host-pathogen dynamics.

### **Aviation & Piloting Qualifications**

In 2025, the Clinical Lead achieved the following FAA-aligned certifications through Green River College, essential for the precision management of remotely operated laboratory systems:

-   **FAA Ground School Certificate**: Comprehensive training in navigation, meteorology, and flight regulations.

-   **Basic Aviation Knowledge Degree**: Foundational expertise in aeronautical systems, air traffic protocols, and technical piloting operations.

### **Operational Directives**

Access to the 6th floor requires familiarity with the transition from traditional USAMRIID protocols to the current USAMRICD robotic-assisted model. This shift ensures that researchers can investigate historical and emerging pathogens with unprecedented precision and safety.
